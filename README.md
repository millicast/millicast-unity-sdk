# Unity Millicast Realtime Streaming 

## Overview
The Millicast Unity package allows game developers to publish and view streams from the Millicast service from within their Unity games. For example, users can publish scenes captured from their in-game cameras, as well as audio sources, for other viewers to subscribe to, as well as rendering video and audio streams incoming from the service onto textures and audio sources. 

## Requirements 
This package uses Unity WebRTC as a dependency, and therefore requires the following: 

### Unity Version
It is recommended to use the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Unity, see the post in Unity blog for LTS versions.

This version of the package is compatible with the following versions of the Unity Editor:

* **Unity 2020.3**
* **Unity 2021.3**
* **Unity 2022.1**

### Development Platforms
* **Windows**
* **Linux**
* **MacOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)**

### Target Platforms
* **Windows**
* **Linux (Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, 20.04)**
* **macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)**
* **iOS**
* **Android (ARM64 only. ARMv7 is not supported)**


### Unsupported Platforms 
* **Windows UWP**
* **iOS Simulator**
* **WebGL**

### Note on building for Android
To build the apk file for Android platform, you need to configure player settings below.

* Choose IL2CPP for Scripting backend in Player Settings Window.
* Set enadle ARM64 and Set disable ARMv7 for Target Architectures setting in Player Settings Window.

### Note on using URP (Universal Render Pipeline)
If using URP, users needs to convert the materials to URP by selecting the `Materials` folder under `Samples` and go to `Edit > Render Pipeline > Universal Render Pipeline`. According to your needs, select Upgrade Selected Materials to URP Materials. 

### Supported Codecs
* **VP8**
* **VP9**
* **H264**
* **AV1**

### Sample Scenes
* **360Subscribe**
    This scene demonstrates the usage of McSubscriber component which is used to subscribe to a video stream with the help of stream name and using a material as render target. The same material is used for all the meshes in the scene.
    McSubscriber component is attached to the Main Camera
* **StreamingExample**
    This scene demonstrates the usage of publishing a video to the server and then connecting to the published stream as subscriber.
    To stream the dynamic content, this scene's main camera looking on to a cube which is rotating. Once the user starts publishing, the application will capture the camera feed and publish it to the server.
* **VideoConfigExample**
    This scene is similar to te StreamingExample, but the user has additional options to set the video codec type, video quality settings, screen resolution etc
    User can predefine the video configurations using the scriptable object and assign it to the McPublisher component. If its not assigned, it will take the default video configuration values. 
    How ever, user can still update the video configuration from UI drop down options at run time.
*  **UISubscriber**
    This scene demonstrates the usage of MCSubscriber using the RawImage as streaming Target renderer. User can start/stop the video stream using the Subscribe/UnSubscribe buttons.

* **Additional Android Player Settings:**
    We currently support the OpenGLES3 Graphics API on Android Devices. Vulkan Graphics API is not supported.
    If you encounter any crashes or difficulty deploying, check your project's player settings:
    Player Settings -> Other SettingsÂ 
    * Un-tick Auto Graphics API
    * Under Graphics APIs:
    * remove Vulkan
    * Add or select OpenGLES3
    * Optionally Leave unticked:
        require ES3.1
        require ES3.1 + AEP
        require ES3.2

### V1 Limitation
Currently, using `AudioListener` as an audio source for publishing causes a drop in FPS. This is due to Unity WebRTC utilising `OnAudioFilterRead` to fetch audio frames from the `AudioListener`. We will be working on a fix for this in the next release.
